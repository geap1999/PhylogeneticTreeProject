Phylogenetic tree project made with Java. The main program "Project" is found in the "Main" package. It only takes in input fasta files paths and gives out a text phylogenetic tree built with either UPGMA or NJ method, to the users choice. The fasta files content need to be different from one another and have the same number of caracters.
